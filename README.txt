This project is to show my HTML "Chops" from Odin. Before I even begin I
suspect it's going to be somewhat easy because I am prett familiar with HTML,
but, we'll see! 

Going to be making from UL (un-ordered lsits) probbaly from Ordered lists as 
well. Going to add pictures as well I imagine. Plus this is good practice
for git commands as they are completely new to me.
